# CV Hockey
I created CV Hockey (Computer Vision Hockey) for an assignment in which I was tasked to use the [OpenCV](https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/ofxOpenCv/) library to create an interactive experience that requires the tracking of 2 or more objects via color-tracking or background subtraction.

I came up with the idea of making an ice hockey game where players control their paddles by moving a tracked object on camera. I added the option to detect objects via background subtraction or color-tracking.
